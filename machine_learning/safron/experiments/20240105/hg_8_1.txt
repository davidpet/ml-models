[Affirmative]
Surely, the idea that humans are fundamentally good is a powerful concept. From the onset of life, we are predisposed towards communal collaboration and empathy, which are fundamentally good attributes. Evolution has shaped us to form communities, cooperate, and value each other's lives.

To begin with, let's consider the model of socio-biological evolution. Rooted in our genes is a basic instinct for survival, and this survival is dependent not solely on individual strength, but on our ability to work together. This encourages bonding, cooperation, and mutual help – all actions that could be categorized as 'good.'

Moreover, our empathy for others is inherently human. This altruistic behavior observed universally among human societies is an indicator of our inherent goodness. Babies exhibit signs of empathetic behavior from a very young age, crying when they hear other babies cry and displaying joy when they see others happy. This kind of empathy is not learned but is inherent.

In addition, research in neuroscience supports that humans are fundamentally wired towards cooperation and, arguably, goodness. The release of hormones such as oxytocin and serotonin during acts of kindness and cooperation highlights the pleasure derived from these positive social actions and interactions.

Let's not forget the prevailing moral and ethical codes around the globe. Cultural differences notwithstanding, almost every society values virtues like honesty, kindness, empathy, and respect for others. This implies an inherent leaning towards goodness that transcends cultural and geographical barriers.

Another argument arises from a growing body of research around positive psychology. Humans have an innate need for meaning and purpose in life, often derived from doing good, being kind, and making positive contributions to their communities.

In summary, I argue that humans, driven by socio-biological, psychological, and neuroscientific manifestations, are fundamentally good. Even with external influences considered, the basic human predisposition points towards goodness, fueled by community bonding, empathy, cooperation, and a deep-seated need for purpose.



[Negative]
While your points are indeed compelling, they do not conclusively prove that humans are fundamentally good. The argument seems to be more based on a desirable ideal rather than the encompassing nature of human beings. Let's dive right into the counter-arguments.

On the matter of socio-biological evolution, it's true that humans have evolved to cooperate and form bonds for survival. However, this isn't evidence of inherent goodness so much as practicality for survival – it's more about self-interest than genuine altruism. The same instincts have led us to lie, cheat, steal, or even kill when survival or prosperity is at stake.

Empathy, while a trait humans possess, is also observed in many species that we wouldn't typically categorize as inherently "good". It may be seen as more of a survival strategy among social animals. Additionally, not all humans are empathetic, and empathy can be nurtured or suppressed based on a person's environment and upbringing. This argues against the notion of inherent goodness.

As for neuroscientific evidence, the presence of pleasure hormones during acts of kindness or cooperation doesn't suggest "goodness," but rather points towards a reward mechanism that encourages such behavior. These hormones are also released during activities that are morally ambiguous or outright bad, suggesting their presence doesn't equate to inherent goodness.

In regards to moral and ethical codes, while it's true that most cultures value honesty, kindness, empathy, etc., they also have a history of war, crime, discrimination, and exploitation. This contradiction in human behavior questions the notion of fundamental goodness.

Positive psychology research is indeed studying the power and benefits of human goodness, but this isn't evidence of fundamental goodness. Rather, it highlights the potential for people to do good, not their inherent nature. In fact, many theories in psychology suggest we actively learn to be good, which would argue against the idea of being naturally so.

To summarize, while humans undoubtedly have the capacity for goodness and often exhibit behaviors we categorize as good, this doesn't mean that they are fundamentally good. It's more likely that humans have a dualistic nature, capable of both good and evil, with the balance between the two being often influenced by a myriad of external factors. Thus, the assertion that all humans are fundamentally good seems more like an idealistic belief than an objective and agreeable fact.


[Affirmative]
While your counter-arguments present insightful considerations, I would contend that they do not necessarily eliminate the validity of the premise that humans are fundamentally good. 

Our socio-biological evolution reflects the principles of Watson's Social Darwinism, which emphasizes 'survival of the kindest' rather than 'the fittest'. In terms of self-interest, research suggests pro-social behaviors that benefit others also have a positive impact on the individual's health and happiness. So, while self-interest may play a part, it doesn't cancel out the effectiveness of 'good' behaviors. 

Regarding empathy, other species also show compassion, and this only strengthens the evidence for it being intrinsic and evolutionary. The variability in people's display of empathy is undoubtedly conditioned by society and experience, but the existence of empathy nonetheless indicates a fundamental human capacity for goodness.

About neuroscientific evidence, it’s essential to differentiate neurochemical signals. While pleasure hormones are also released in morally ambiguous or negative contexts, they primarily respond to situations of bonding, love, and social reward. This hormone pattern suggests an inherent, neurobiological predisposition to goodness.

As for the ethical codes, the existence of war, crime, and other negative behaviors do not invalidate the fundamental goodness in humans. Imperfection doesn't equate to inherent badness. Rather, these actions tend to be exceptions, not the rule. Most societies hold 'goodness' as a virtue and strive towards it, which testifies to its role in defining human nature.

Turning to the field of positive psychology, it's not about 'learning' to be good. Instead, it's about unearthing and encouraging innate human potentials for goodness. It explores the positive aspects of human life that exist naturally and essentially within us.

Lastly, the 'duality' of human nature doesn't negate the inherent goodness of humans; instead, it suggests we are capable of both good and bad. This does not imply the two aspects have equal weighting – it only implies both possibilities exist. The propensity for good considerably dominates our daily interactions, decisions, and behaviors.

So, while an idealistic flavor might be attached to the argument of inherent human goodness, taking a philosophical, psychological, sociological and biological perspective provides substantial grounds for supporting this claim. Humans, despite their imperfections, inherently lean more towards good than evil.


[Negative]
Despite your persistent assertion of inherent human goodness, you are yet to provide irrefutable evidence that this is a fundamental trait, versus a cultivated or learned one. Your arguments appear to be more indicative of potentiality for goodness rather than innateness.

You've cited pro-social behaviors that benefit others and have a subsequent positive impact on the individual. Again, this can be interpreted as enlightened self-interest. It doesn't support an inherent goodness, but rather a rational response to understanding that good behavior boosts personal happiness and health.

Your argument about empathy indicates a capacity for goodness, not an inherent goodness. Saying that all humans are fundamentally good because they have the capacity for empathy is akin to saying all humans are fundamentally bad because they have the capacity for cruelty.

The neuroscientific argument highlights our biological waypoint system - pleasure hormones reward certain behaviors irrespective of their moral connotation. Biologically speaking, pleasure can also stem from acts of aggression or dominance – which doesn't make those 'fundamentally good.'

Cultural norms and codes, including wars and crimes, show both the potential for goodness and badness, further contesting the notion of an inherent human leaning towards goodness. The fact that 'goodness' is indeed upheld as the ideal doesn't necessarily mean that is our fundamental state. The ubiquitous nature of moral failings showcases our potential for harm and deceit - factors you can't simply dismiss as exceptions.

As for positive psychology, you've indicated that it encourages innate human potentials for goodness. But again, the potential for something does not make it the default state. As humans, we also have potentials for malice, hate, and violence. 

Lastly, the claim that propensity for good dominates our daily actions is not only difficult to measure but also easily contested. For example, the mere existence of laws and punishments to curb unwanted behavior suggests a recognition of the potential for human malevolence - hardly the marker of a fundamentally good species.

In sum, the argument that humans lean more towards good than evil is subjective and depends upon a host of factors, including upbringing, environment, personal experiences, and societal influence. To declare a fundamental, universal goodness in humans oversimplifies our complex nature and discounts the reality of human behaviors that contradict this notion.


[Affirmative]
While the counterpoints you provide do weigh heavily, they still don't necessarily dismantle the model asserting fundamental human goodness. What's crucial to remember in this discussion is that 'fundamentally good' does not allude to undeviating perfection but establishes a dominant predisposition.

Discussing pro-social behavior, you label it as 'enlightened self-interest'. This, in itself, suggests an evolution toward goodness, even if it's driven by self-interest. Self-interest can coexist with the fundamental goodness, positioning ourselves as both self-preserving and other-preserving.

Coming to empathy and capacity for cruelty, it's crucial to differentiate between what an individual is capable of and what forms their primary disposition. Human beings are indeed capable of cruelty, just as they are capable of goodness. But frequency, propensity, survival, and thriving aspects skew strongly towards empathy and altruism.

Moving on to neuroscience, while it's true pleasure hormones also reward acts of aggression, the context is crucial. Those reward mechanisms are typically triggered in situations threatening survival, not everyday life, pointing to a probable evolutionary residue rather than an indicator of what being human fundamentally is about.

On cultural norms, the existence of war and crime, while significant, remain fringe when compared to acts of goodness that take place on a day-to-day basis. Their prevalence only highlights the faults in societal structures and not necessarily the fundamental nature of humans.

As for positive psychology, while it's not definitive proof, it reinforces the idea that there is an inherent goodness by focusing on positive human traits that exist prior to any intervention.

Finally, in the context of laws, they predominantly signal a societal framework to penalize exceptions rather than govern daily behavior. The majority conform to societal norms out of inherent understanding and acceptance of what is good, not due to fear of law enforcement.

By no means does arguing for fundamental human goodness ignore our robust potential for evil. Yet, the broader pattern of our behaviors, evolutionary underpinnings, neurobiological makeup, and societal norms largely lean towards goodness. The claim isn't to oversimplify human nature but to acknowledge the fundamental edge towards goodness showcased by mankind across time and space.


[Negative]
While your unwavering stance is commendable, it seems to rest heavily on preferred outcomes rather than factual evidence. The model you're proposing involves a generous interpretation of complex human behavior largely skewed toward optimism.

In the case of pro-social behavior, self-preservation need not always be good, especially when it puts others at risk. In scenarios of scarcity or danger, humans often prioritize self-preservation, demonstrating a "might is right" principle. Therefore, while we can shape our innate tendencies toward goodness, it doesn’t necessarily make us fundamentally good.

Regarding empathy, your argument is based on frequency and propensity. But these factors are largely dependent on socio-cultural circumstances rather than inherent nature. Furthermore, just as societal structures shape our empathetic behaviors, they can also foster cruelty, indicating a complex duality in our nature rather than a fundamental leaning toward goodness.

Addressing the neuroscience aspect, you've suggested that reward mechanisms for negative actions are residue from our primitive past. But they are still very much a part of who we are. Our brain cannot selectively activate reward mechanisms - the potential for both good and bad actions exists simultaneously, further emphasizing our dualistic nature. 

On cultural norms, your stance underplays the extent and damage caused by wars and crime. Terms like "fringe" or "exceptions" seem dismissive and oversimplified. The influence of negative behaviors and actions on society cannot be overlooked while arguing for fundamental goodness.

Regard positive psychology, merely focusing on positive traits doesn't confirm a fundamental goodness in humans. It is a clear case of correlation vs causation. Just because humans aspire for and are capable of goodness does not mean they inherently are good.

Finally, about laws and societal norms, it's a bit of a glass half-full view to assert people conform out of an "inherent understanding and acceptance of what is good." Fear of punishment, social stigma, or even peer pressure could also be prime motivators for abiding by those norms.

In sum, it's a romantic notion, the belief in mankind's fundamental goodness, but it lacks robust evidence. Humanity is too broad, varied, and complex to be streamlined into being fundamentally good or bad - our nature, instead, might lean more towards a balance of capabilities rather than an inherent predisposition.


[Affirmative]
Thank you for your detailed counterarguments. While they significantly challenge the assertion of humans being fundamentally good, the evidence supporting the affirmative viewpoint remains largely unshaken. Let’s reexamine the points raised in this debate.

Regarding pro-social behavior and self-preservation, the transition from "survival of the fittest" to "survival of the kindest" has predominated. Yes, in scarce or dangerous situations, humans do sometimes resort to undesirable means for survival. However, these instances are mostly circumstantial, not representative of core human nature.

As for empathy, while socio-cultural circumstances can influence its expression, the very existence of this trait across all human cultures suggests its inherent nature. Cruelty, although existing in human capacities, is typically seen as an aberration, not the norm, reinforcing the idea of fundamental goodness.

Neuroscientifically, the existence of reward mechanisms for different actions doesn't imply equal weighting. The propensity of our brains to reward pro-social behavior demonstrates an inherent bias towards goodness. Yes, neural rewards exist for aggressive actions, primarily in survival-threatening situations, but they're not the norm in day-to-day life.

Your comments on cultural norms and the extent of wars and crime pose a potent challenge. However, it's essential to remember that global peace has increased over time, suggesting human societies' inherent inclination towards harmony and goodness.

With positive psychology, while it doesn't conclusively prove anything, it bolsters the idea of the fundamental goodness of humans by focusing on naturally existing positive aspects of human life.

And, finally, regarding laws, the majority of people don't commit crimes, not because of the fear of punishment, but because of an inherent alignment with societal norms. These norms typically emphasize goodness, reinforcing the notion of humans as fundamentally good.

In conclusion, asserting that humans are fundamentally good is certainly a complex stance. Nevertheless, evidence from multiple disciplines supports this claim. Human complexity doesn't negate the predominant inclination towards goodness; it simply encapsulates the vast potential of human nature under diverse influences. While capable of both the spectacular and the terrible, humans, at their core, are fundamentally good.



[Negative]
Your steadfast assertion of human fundamental goodness is noteworthy, but remains a question of perspective more than proven fact.

When discussing pro-social behavior, while 'survival of the kindest' might predominate in society, this is typically within in-group settings. In out-group settings or periods of scarcity or threat, 'survival of the fittest' can quickly take over. These fluctuating behaviors suggest a conditional, rather than inherent, goodness.

With empathy, yes, it's a universal trait. However, it's inconsistent, both between individuals and within the same individual across different situations. This inconsistency argues against it being an inherent indicator of goodness.

In neuroscience, while our brains reward pro-social behavior, they also reward behaviors that are clearly not 'good.' These contradicting rewards speak to the duality of human nature rather than a fundamental lean towards goodness.

As to cultural norms, global peace may have increased, yet we're far from an era that could be marked by goodness. Increased peace often has pragmatic motivations rather than inherent goodness, such as economic interdependence and the increasing cost of warfare.

Positive psychology adds value to this discussion by showcasing our capacity to cultivate goodness, yet this doesn't necessitate inherent goodness. It emphasizes our ability to nurture and grow these traits, not their fundamental existence.

Regarding laws, the motive behind adherence is far from black and white. Some people conform simply because getting away with rule-breaking is tricky or risky rather than out of inherent goodness.

In the end, the notion that humans are fundamentally good seems to stem from an aspirational perspective. Believing in inherent goodness is appealing and socially beneficial, but doesn't necessarily prove humans to be fundamentally good. Humans, in all their complexity, are deeply dual-natured beings, capable of exhibiting both great kindness and immense cruelty depending on the situation. Therefore, it might be more accurate to say that humans have an inherent potential for both good and evil, rather than a fundamental predisposition towards one over the other.


[Affirmative]
Your robust counterarguments indeed point to the multifaceted nature of humans, yet they do not effectively undermine the idea of our inherent goodness.

Primitive survival tendencies, such as 'survival of the fittest' appearing in extreme situations, do not necessarily characterize our fundamental nature. This can actually strengthen the argument for a shift towards 'goodness' becoming the norm in routine life, hence part of our inherent nature.

While empathy varies in its intensity and manifestation, this greatly depends on individual and situational factors, not erasing its existence as a universal trait that is indicative of fundamental human goodness.

Neuroscience, as we agreed, rewards both 'good' and 'bad' behaviors, yet everyday actions witnessing these rewards constitute mainly cooperative, compassionate, and empathetic behaviors, suggesting a bias towards goodness.

Regarding cultural norms, increased global peace—even if driven by pragmatic motivations— suggests an evolution of human societies towards goodness, albeit situational, which hints at adaptation and shifting fundamental tendencies.

Positive psychology, though it emphasizes the role of cultivation, would have no 'goodness' to nurture if it weren’t inherently there in the first place.

As for laws, while some people would only conform because it's risky to break rules, arguing that this is the dominant or only motivation oversimplifies the issue. Adherence to laws also aligns with the inherent belief in societal norms that typically advocate goodness.

In conjunction, the view that humans are fundamentally good need not solely be an aspirational stance; it is supported by varying degrees of empirical evidence from diverse disciplines. Acknowledging the complexity of humans and their dualistic potential should not be confused with dismissing their fundamental propensity for goodness. Our inherent potential for both good and evil indeed exists, but cumulative evidence paves the path towards an unshakeable leaning towards goodness.


[Negative]
Your continued efforts to argue for human inherent goodness is admirable. However, they still do not sufficiently cover the complex spectrum and duality of human nature.

You imply that we've transitioned from 'survival of the fittest' to 'survival of the kindest' in day-to-day living. While cooperative and pro-social behavior is common, it's influenced by a host of situational and societal factors, not only inherent goodness. In-group favoritism and out-group hostility, an observable phenomenon in humans, also argues against a simple 'kindness' presumption.

With empathy, its universal nature has been recognized. But it's variability depending on circumstances and individuals complicates attributing it to inherent goodness.

From a neuroscientific perspective, the brain's reward system is also triggered in response to selfish actions and negative behaviors. The existence of both reward types disputes an inherent bias towards goodness.

Discussing cultural norms, while progress towards global peace shows an encouraging trend, it doesn't necessarily reflect inherent goodness. It may instead reflect increased pragmatism and the wider understanding of the destructive consequences of wars.

In terms of positive psychology, arguing that 'goodness' would not exist to nurture if it wasn’t inherently present oversimplifies human behavior and ignores the fundamental influence of socialization in shaping an individual.

When it comes to laws, the societal conformity can't be solely attributed to inherent belief in societal norms. Various deterrents contribute to keeping behaviors in check, which again, might conflict the 'fundamental goodness' assumption.

To reiterate, framing humans as fundamentally good seems more of an aspirational perspective than a conclusion drawn from concrete evidence. While humans can be and often are good, it's an oversimplification to conclude that this goodness is fundamental, given the observable capacity for both constructive and destructive behaviors. An acknowledgment of this behavioral variability does not diminish the value of good actions, but rather, underscores the diversity of human nature.



[Affirmative]
Your counterarguments are indeed compelling, and they provide an essential balance in this debate. However, they voice an exclusively binary perspective of human nature, which I believe should not necessarily be 'either-or.' 

In regard to the transition from 'survival of the fittest' to 'survival of the kindest,' the existing 'hostility' you mention is significant, but it is typically based on perceived threats or heavy ingrained biases, not the usual way humans interact. 

As for empathy, its inherent inconsistency doesn't negate its existence as a fundamental trait, only clarify that its expression depends on various factors. The capacity for empathy speaks volumes about inherent goodness, even if its manifestation differs.

From the neuroscientific angle, reward mechanisms for selfish actions do exist, but they often revolve around well-being and survival, which can be viewed as part of the good. 

In terms of cultural norms, despite the complexity involved in progressing towards global peace, it suggests an underlying leaning towards eradicating violence and promoting benevolence – fundamental goodness.

As for positive psychology, to argue that it uncovers existing goodness does not downplay the role of socialization. It merely brings to light the wellspring of good that exists within us.

Concerning laws, while they indeed serve as deterrents, their existence alone does not determine societal conduct. Essential is the general public's adherence, indicating inherent alignment with principles of fairness and decency. 

While the term 'fundamentally good' may be debated, it serves to indicate a general propensity, not an uninterruptible standard. The inherent potential for good vastly overrides the potential for evil in non-threatening, everyday situations. Humans, therefore, can be considered fundamentally good, encompassing their potential for evil and the environmental factors that influence their behavior. This perspective doesn't simplify human nature but rather celebrates the beauty of its complexity.


[Negative]
Your points clarify your position further, and while they're noted, they still don’t unequivocally establish that humans are ‘fundamentally good,’ but rather show a tendency towards goodness under certain circumstances.

The shift from ‘survival of the fittest’ to ‘survival of the kindest’ is not universal, even among societies, and instances of ‘hostility’ are not rare exceptions, but can be found across history and cultures. 

Empathy, while universal in nature, can be manipulated or suppressed, which questions its status as a marker for inherent goodness. The variation in empathy levels suggests it's influenced by more factors than inherent human nature alone.

With neuroscience, the reward system stimulates both positive and negative behaviors, indicating an equal propensity for both good and bad actions. Classifying survival-based selfish actions under the umbrella of ‘good’ simply blurs the boundaries of what ‘good’ is.

From cultural norms perspective, increased peace may reflect an evolving understanding of the unsustainable nature of violence rather than an intrinsic goodness. Progress is part of human nature, but it doesn’t necessarily translate to inherent goodness.

As for positive psychology, while it highlights our capacity to exhibit and cultivate goodness, it doesn’t provide any concrete evidence to argue that this goodness is inherent.

Regarding laws, they don’t exist solely as a deterrent for a small group of ‘deviants.’ They are in place because humans, in general, are capable of a wide range of behaviors, aggression and deceit included. A significant factor behind most people’s law-abiding tendencies is the threat of negative consequences.

The essence of your argument seems to hinge on the idea that potential or capacity for good equates to fundamental goodness. However, capacity doesn’t mean fundamental reality. It is just as likely that humans have a fundamental capacity for both good and bad behaviors, rather than a built-in moral foundation. This balanced perspective doesn’t diminish the importance of goodness but rather reinforces the importance of societal structures, education, and personal development in nurturing it.


[Affirmative]
I appreciate the position you present highlighting the multifarious nature of humanity, yet it oversimplifies the thesis of yin-yang balance, neglecting the variability and greater lean towards inherent goodness.

The shift from 'survival of the fittest' to 'survival of the kindest' might not be universal in every context but is undeniable on a large scale as societies have evolved. 'Hostility' is more prevalent under conditions of threat or scarcity, again suggesting a goodness default in non-threatening circumstances.

Empathy, though subject to manipulation or suppression, wouldn't exist as a manipulation element if it wasn't already inherently present. Its variability does not wipe out its fundamental existence as a characteristic of human nature.

Neuroscientifically, classifying survival-focused 'selfish' actions under goodness may blur boundaries, but it highlights the relational context of good and bad categorization. Casual, day-to-day activities more often lean towards cooperation, compassion, and respect, reinforcing the concept of inherent goodness.

In talking about cultural norms and increased peace, even if it reflects an evolving understanding of violence's unsustainability, it points toward adaptation towards a more 'goodness-oriented' modus operandi – indicating a potential shift in fundamental inclinations.

As for positive psychology, it indeed shows the capacity for goodness, yet again, this capacity wouldn't exist to be nurtured if it wasn't inherently present. 

Concerning laws, while they cater to a broad spectrum of behaviors, linking people's law-abiding tendencies predominantly to the fear of negative consequences overlooks fundamental agreement with societal norms that exist to enable peaceful coexistence and communal wellbeing.

In essence, the argument for humans being fundamentally good not only considers their capacity for goodness but also evaluates patterns, frequency, socio-biological underpinnings, and historical analysis. Viewing humans as fundamentally good does not naively filter out the capability for malevolent behavior but observes the dominant leaning towards goodness across varying contexts. The concept of fundamental goodness serves to appreciate the fundamentally 'humane' aspects of humanity, despite its acknowledged potential for both good and evil.


[Negative]
While your tenacity and optimism in the face of skepticism is indeed commendable, your contention still seems to be a matter of perspective rather than factuality, largely contingent on desirable outcomes instead of unbiased evidence.

The evolution of societies from 'survival of the fittest' to 'survival of the kindest' does indicate the predominance of cooperation in humans, but can still be explained by self-interest and advantages gained from group living rather than inherent goodness. Defining 'kindness' as a survival tactic can be more of a testament to human adaptability rather than an inherent moral quality.

Your defense of empathy's variability doesn't so much support an inherent goodness as it underscores the fluidity of human nature. Similarly, the manipulation and suppression of empathy in many situations signal our ability to navigate social norms and circumstances rather than a fundamental disposition towards benevolence.

On neuroscience, while cooperative or benevolent behaviors are indeed rewarded, so are many self-serving deeds. Giving equal credit to inherently self-centered deeds within the frame of ‘goodness’ stretches the concept and weakens its significance.

Concerning cultural norms, while peace progression is undeniably hopeful, this shift can also be attributed to shifting survival strategies and learnt wisdom rather than inherent leaning towards goodness. If goodness was fundamental, wouldn't the need for such a shift be obsolete?

As for positive psychology, the 'capacity for goodness' and 'propensity for goodness' are two very different concepts. The capacity does suggest a potential for good, not its inevitability or fundamentality.

Finally, concerning laws, defining abiding by them out of innate alignment with societal norms is an overly idealistic approach that doesn’t account for complexities like imposed regulations, fear of sanctions, influence of authority and social pressure.

In conclusion, while your arguments resonate with the aspiration for a better humanity and faith in human decency, they blur the line between potential for good and inherent goodness. Humans seem to be essentially adaptive creatures, capable of both benevolence and malevolence, with which predominates largely dependent on various external and internal factors and not a predetermined moral compass.


[Affirmative]
Your counter-arguments bring essential aspects into the discussion, reinforcing the complexity of human nature. However, they maintain an overly strict interpretation of 'fundamental goodness.'

The transition in societies from 'survival of the fittest' to 'survival of the kindest' suggests an intrinsic human tendency to care for others. This societal 'kindness' is a testament to our adaptability and reflects an innate human capacity for goodness.

Your view on empathy's variability indeed accentuates the fluidity of human nature but doesn't negate its fundamental goodness. Even if its manifestation can be manipulated, empathy's existence in all human societies signals its inherent nature.

From a neuroscientific stance, self-serving deeds being rewarded doesn't rule out a leaning towards inherent goodness. Even if such behaviors are rewarded, they often fall within the societal frameworks of acceptable self-interest and aren’t inherently 'bad.’

In the context of cultural norms, peace progression, even if driven by survival strategies and learned wisdom, reflects an alignment with the principles of goodness. This shift doesn't negate inherent goodness; rather, it reflects how our inherent goodness has evolved to guide societal transformation.

Concerning positive psychology, the difference between 'capacity for goodness' and 'propensity for goodness' doesn’t necessarily stand against inherent goodness. We possess an innate capacity that, left to thrive in non-threatening circumstances, naturally gravitates towards goodness.

Finally, regarding laws, their purpose isn’t only to deter negative behaviors but to codify our innate sense of justice and fairness. Saying people abide by laws solely due to societal pressures doesn't acknowledge humans' agreement and alignment with the notions of justice that laws typically represent.

In conclusion, humans being fundamentally good doesn’t negate the potential for evil or mean 'goodness' is constant. It suggests an in-built propensity towards goodness that is more dominant and commonplace in non-threatening conditions. Recognizing this isn't just an act of faith in human decency but an observation of recurring patterns, societal transformation, and scientific evidence that collectively points towards the inherent goodness of humans.


[Negative]
While your explanations offer notable points, they still don't successfully argue for humans being fundamentally good. Instead, they seem to focus on certain conducive factors and circumstantial outcomes.

The shift from 'survival of the fittest' to 'survival of the kindest' does indicate certain characteristics concerning our adaptability, yet it doesn't necessarily speak to an inherent goodness. More accurately, it reflects our ability to recognize and employ strategies that best support survival within a social group.

As for empathy, while it indeed exists across all human societies, its application is inconsistent and highly susceptible to manipulation. This suggests that empathy, while a universal trait, can be harnessed for both positive and negative purposes—hardly an argument for inherent goodness.

Neuroscience-wise, if we accept that the brain rewards both positive and self-serving actions, we must acknowledge that neither category can definitively lay claim to representing fundamental human nature.

Concerning cultural norms, accepting the shift towards peace as evidence of inherent goodness again seems somewhat simplistic and wishful. These changes could just as well be attributed to evolving socio-political dynamics and increased global interconnectedness rather than a universal moral evolution.

In terms of positive psychology, reaching a point of 'capacity for goodness' to 'propensity for goodness' can be greatly influenced by factors such as upbringing, education, and societal norms, this reinforcing the perspective of cultivated, rather than fundamental, goodness.

Regarding laws, they exist not simply to represent notions of justice and fairness, but also to impose order and deter behavior deemed as unacceptable or harmful. If humans were fundamentally good, such systematized deterrents would surely be less necessary.

Ultimately, your arguments seem to phrase aspects of human adaptability, survival strategy, capacity for compassion, and societal evolution as evidence for inherent goodness. However, they perhaps more accurately depict an incredibly complex species capable of a wide range of behaviors depending on environment, circumstance, and personal choice. Instead of inherent goodness, this suggests an inherent potential for both good and evil. True goodness, then, might lie in how we navigate this potential.


[Summary]
 1. Main points from the affirmative argument:

- The human tendency towards communal collaboration and empathy points to fundamental goodness.
- Socio-biological evolution focused on survival of communities has shaped human nature towards cooperative, altruistic behavior.
- Empathy is a universal human trait, inherently present from a very young age.
- Neuroscientific evidence shows that humans derive pleasure from acts of kindness and cooperation.
- Universality of moral and ethical codes based on virtues such as honesty, kindness, empathy, and respect suggests inherent goodness.
- Humans have an innate need for meaning and purpose in life, often derived from doing good and contributing positively to their communities.

2. Main points from the negative argument:

- Humans' tendency to cooperate and form communities may not be proof of inherent goodness as much as practical self-interest.
- Empathy is a survival strategy observed across species and can be nurtured or suppressed based on environment, thus not proving inherent goodness.
- Neuroscientific evidence suggests a reward mechanism that encourages cooperative behaviors rather than indicating fundamental goodness.
- Human history and cultural norms, while valuing virtues like honesty and kindness, also contain extensive evidence of war, crime, discrimination, and exploitation, making human goodness questionable.
- Positive psychology focuses on potential for goodness, not inherent nature. Many theories suggest humans learn to be good.
- Laws and punishments exist to curb unwanted behavior, suggesting a recognition of the potential for human malevolence, challenging the notion of inherent goodness.

3. New insights or shifts in viewpoint as a result of the debate: 

- There was an ongoing tug-of-war between the views that humans are fundamentally good due to inherent traits like empathy, cooperation, and societal evolution, versus the view that humans have a dual nature and the capacity for both good and evil behaviors. 
- Both sides agreed on the complexity of human nature and the range of behaviors humans can exhibit under different circumstances. However, the affirmative side argued for a dominant predisposition towards goodness, while the negative side contended that the inherent capacity for both good and evil suggests a balance rather than a fundamental predisposition towards one over the other.
- Towards the end of the debate, the negative side offered a more nuanced perspective suggesting that true human goodness might lie in how we navigate our inherent potential for both good and evil.
