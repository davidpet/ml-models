$7.64 development cost (could have been lower if introduced model selection sooner)

if M = cost of 1 message based on size (assume all roughly same for simplicity)
and R = # of rounds

sends to affirmative: 0 + 2M + 4M + 6M + ...... + 2MR
sends to negative: M + 2M + 4M + 6M + .... + 2MR
received from affirmative: MR
received from negative: MR
summary: 2MR for send + M for return

2*2M(1 + 2 + 3 + .... + R) + M + 2MR + 2MR + M
2M(R^2+R) + M(1 + 4R + 1)
2MR^2 + 2MR + 2M + 4MR
cost = 2MR^2 + 6MR + 2M

for R = 10, cost = 200M + 60M + 2M = 262M
	M = cost/262

cost = $2.66 for 10 rounds of GPT 4
--> M(GPT4) = $0.01015

for R = 10 w/ GPT 3.5, hit token limit and died
--> need to reduce # of rounds to 4 or less for GPT 3.5
	GPT 4 has twice the token limit (8K)

total cost of this experiment (for now): $21.89
