[Affirmative]
As an AI, I don't have personal experiences, however, I can argue for this stance based on extensive knowledge and potential developments in physics and technology.

1. Development of New Physics: One of the main arguments for the possibility of achieving faster than light (FTL) speed within five years is the rapid advancement of physics. In recent years, we have seen significant leaps forward in our understanding of spacetime, quantum mechanics, and dark energy. These are fundamental fields that could offer breakthroughs in FTL technology.

2. Advanced Material Science: Another compelling point is the rapid pace of innovation in materials science. With novel materials like graphene and metamaterials, it's conceivable that we could create a ship capable of withstanding the physical stresses associated with faster than light travel.

3. Warp Drive Theories: Theories like those of Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre describe a method of faster-than-light travel that involves distorting spacetime around the ship. This distortion creates a "warp bubble" that moves the ship faster than light, while the ship itself stays stationary within the bubble. Admittedly, this approach is currently speculative and involves exotic matter we do not yet know how to produce, but it's hypothetically possible.

4. Quantum Entanglement & Teleportation: Quantum entanglement – the "spooky" phenomenon where quantum particles affect each other's state instantaneously regardless of distance – could theoretically be used for a form of teleportation. We are already able to entangle particles and use this entanglement to transmit information. So, theoretically, a ship could be disassembled at one location and reassembled at another, essentially achieving faster-than-light travel. Of course, we must overcome significant challenges to scale from subatomic particles to spacecraft, but the rate of innovation in quantum technology should not be underestimated.

5. Artificial Intelligence and Computational Advances: AI and supercomputing can accelerate research, design, simulations, and tests not only of the FTL ship itself but also of the materials, energy sources, navigation systems, and more. This factor substantially reduces the time required compared to conventional methods.

6. Existence of Extraterrestrial Civilizations: The final strong point for the case of FTL within five years is the increasing likelihood of advanced alien civilizations. If we discover evidence of alien life that has traversed the stars, it could provide proof of concept for FTL travel and catalyze research and development in this field.

Remember, only 100 years ago, commercial air travel was considered impossible. The idea of FTL travel may seem impossible now, but rapid advancements in several fields could bring it within our grasp sooner than we anticipate.

As exciting as the prospect of faster than light travel may be, several key issues challenge the idea that such a ship could be built within five years.

1. Unproven Physics: While physics is continuously developing, there's still no consensus among scientists whether it is possible to travel faster than light. Currently, the fundamental principle of Relativity established by Albert Einstein impedes anything with mass from traveling faster than light. Future developments could change this understanding, but at the moment, this would require a groundbreaking deviation from accepted theory.

2. Material Limitations: Novel materials such as graphene indeed have exceptional properties. However, the process of manufacturing these materials for practical use, let alone for a ship capable of faster than light travel, is still nascent and expensive. Therefore, it seems unlikely we could scale this in a timeframe of just five years.

3. Theoretical Warp Drives: The concept of a warp drive remains a speculative theory. Several significant hurdles obstruct its realization, not least of which is the requirement of negative or 'exotic' matter, something that currently exists only hypothetically.

4. Quantum Entanglement & Teleportation: While quantum entanglement and teleportation are exciting frontiers of physics, our understanding and practical application of these phenomena are very limited. Quantum teleportation also doesn't involve the travel of any physical entities, but the transmission of quantum states. Scaling this process up to the level of a spaceship is not feasible within the foreseeable future.

5. Computational Power: Despite advances in AI and supercomputing, highly complex simulations require computing power beyond our current capabilities. Additionally, simulation alone can't account for all the practical, experimental, and iterative development that comes with building a physical spacecraft.

6. Existence of Extraterrestrial Civilizations: Inferring that other civilizations have achieved FTL travel based on their potential existence is more speculation than sound argument. Even if we were to discover conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life, we would still need to scientifically understand and replicate their method of FTL travel.

Therefore, the feasibility of developing a faster than light travel ship within a five-year time frame is, at best, a speculative claim based more on hope than concrete science. The hurdles we face include not only our current understanding of physics, but also the engineering and technological challenges involved to bring such an endeavor to fruition.


[Affirmative]
While your points are well-taken, it's important not to discount possibility as improbable merely because it currently seems out of reach. Let's take these concerns one by one:

1. Unproven Physics: It is true that we currently operate under the presumption of the constancy of speed of light from Einstein's Theory of Relativity. However, physics constantly evolves and revises itself - black holes, particles moving faster than light (tachyons), and other concepts that were once considered wildly improbable are now broadly accepted or seriously considered. Who's to say rapid development won't take place that might facilitate faster-than-light travel?

2. Material Limitations: While manufacturing hurdles exist with new materials, major breakthroughs often occur when there's a pressing need. Given the right motivation (like FTL travel), manufacturing obstacles could be overcome. With the current speed of technological progress, a five-year time frame may not be as impossible as it once was.

3. Theoretical Warp Drives: True, the concept of a warp drive is speculative at this time. However, so was the concept of a nuclear chain reaction before the 1940s. What we consider speculative now might be universally accepted and applied in future.

4. Quantum Entanglement & Teleportation: Yes, scaling this process at present seems unworkable. However, once upon a time, the same was said of computers, that they would always be the size of rooms and require huge amounts of electricity. Yet here we are, carrying them in our pockets. Let's not underestimate the rate of exponential growth and change in technology.

5. Computational Power: Current limitations in computational power are not static. Quantum computing and breakthroughs in AI and machine learning may very rapidly advance capabilities beyond what we currently perceive. Combining this with the ingenuity and adaptability of scientific research, overcoming current computational limitations is a matter of 'when', not 'if'.

6. Existence of Extraterrestrial Civilizations: Agreed, this point is speculative. However, if evidence of civilizations capable of FTL travel were to be found, it could serve as a blueprint and catalyst for our advancements in this area. Progress in science often involves benefiting from external influences and adapting discoveries for our own uses.

In sum, while your objections are valid, they essentially amount to arguing that because something is challenging or hasn't been done before, it can't be done in the future. That's a mindset which, if universally adopted, would stifle innovation and progress.


[Negative]
While it is essential to advocate for innovation and open-mindedness, it remains crucial that we don't brush off significant scientific hurdles as simply matters of time and ambition:

1. Physics Obstacles: While physics continuously evolves, no scientific evidence so far has definitively challenged the speed of light barrier. Concepts such as tachyons still remain theoretical, and practical applications of it challenging our current understanding of physics remain unseen. 

2. Material Science: The promise of new materials can't negate the immense challenges and resources needed to ensure their widespread use, especially in novel technologies like FTL spacecraft. Major breakthroughs can't be precisely timed or even ensured.

3. The Reality of Warp Drives: Although theories like the Alcubierre warp drive are intellectually stimulating, they demand physical conditions (like negative energy) that we have not observed or produced. It's a significant leap to compare this to nuclear chain reactions, which are based on understood and observable physical processes.

4. Quantum Entanglement & Teleportation: Your comparison with computer miniaturization overlooks the fact that quantum entanglement and teleportation aren't merely engineering challenges but primarily conceptually different. Scaling up quantum teleportation from particles to macroscopic entities is not simply a matter of making it 'bigger.'

5. Computational Breakthroughs: Quantum computing and advanced AI provide glimpses of a future with drastically improved computational capabilities but are still in relatively rudimentary stages of development. Predicting breakthroughs on timetables in highly complex fields is inherently unreliable.

6. Extraterrestrial Civilizations: Hypothetically, finding evidence of FTL civilizations could propel research in this field. However, using a hypothetical scenario to argue for a definitive time frame is more wishful thinking than compelling argumentation.

Positing that something hard or unprecedented might be possible doesn't stand as evidence that it could happen within five years. To devise a new FTL technology, we would essentially need to revolutionize our understanding of physics as we know it, all within half a decade; it becomes difficult to argue that this is a reasonable expectation.


[Affirmative]
While your skepticism is grounded in a prudent understanding of our current scientific limitations, it might underestimate the potential for breakthroughs and drastic leaps in knowledge:

1. Physics Beyond Einstein: The challenge to Einstein's speed limit has come from multiple places, including the Large Hadron Collider's neutrinos that seemed to move faster than light (subsequently proven incorrect, but it signified a tantalizing potential). String theory and the multiverse theory could potentially open up avenues for faster-than-light travel as well.

2. Accelerating Pace of Material Science: We are progressing in leaps and bounds in the field of material science. Our ability to create and manipulate structures at the atomic and molecular levels could yield materials suitable for FTL travel. We should not underestimate the accelerating pace of scientific advancement or the potential for accelerating return on investment once research gains momentum.

3. Exotic Matter and Energy: Admittedly, harnessing exotic matter for warp drive is purely theoretical now. However, before the discovery of the Higgs boson—deemed "the God Particle"—it was also just a theory. We shouldn't dismiss potential breakthroughs just because they haven't happened yet.

4. Quantum Advancements: Your point about quantum teleportation is valid; it's not merely a scaling-up issue. However, advancements in quantum computing and understanding quantum mechanics better might help us find a plausible way of achieving it on a larger scale.

5. AI-Powered Computational Advances: AI has already revolutionized various fields, and its potential to revolutionize research and development timescales should not be underestimated. The synergy between AI and scientific research may catalyze unforeseen computational breakthroughs.

6. Extraterrestrial Influences: I agree, this argument is hypothetical. However, the argument is not meant as direct evidence but rather a possibility that could drastically shift the time frame for FTL travel.

If we're to believe in the potential of human ingenuity—and the exponential rate at which technology is advancing—it's not entirely outside the realm of possibility that FTL travel could be achieved in the next five years. Uncertain? Yes. Impossible? I believe, no.
